# Functional Enrichment MATLAB Scripts
Contains scripts that:

* format curated SGD aspect and complex annotations and calculate the P-value of the hypergeometric distribution test.
* calculate a normalized area-under-curve (AUC) score that encodes both distribution shape and location
* calculate a multiplicative epistasis score.

Here, the epistasis score is defined according to [Phenix et al.'s research.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002048).
